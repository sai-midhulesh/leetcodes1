A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
Example 2:
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        max_path = float("-inf")  # placeholder to be updated
        
        def get_max_gain(node):
            nonlocal max_path  # This tells that max_path is not a local variable
            if node is None:
                return 0
                
            gain_on_left = max(get_max_gain(node.left), 0)  # Read the part important 
            gain_on_right = max(get_max_gain(node.right), 0)  # Read the part important 
            
            current_max_path = node.val + gain_on_left + gain_on_right  # Read first three 
            max_path = max(max_path, current_max_path) 
            
            return node.val + max(gain_on_left, gain_on_right)
        
        get_max_gain(root)  # Starts the recursion chain
        return max_path
