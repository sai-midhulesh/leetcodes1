You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a 0-indexed integer array security, where security[i] is the number of guards on duty on the ith day. The days are numbered starting from 0. You are also given an integer time.
The ith day is a good day to rob the bank if:
There are at least time days before and after the ith day,
The number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-increasing, and
The number of guards at the bank for the time days after i are non-decreasing.
More formally, this means day i is a good day to rob the bank if and only if security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time].

Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order that the days are returned in does not matter.
Example 1:

Input: security = [5,3,3,3,5,6,2], time = 2
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
On day 2, we have security[0] >= security[1] >= security[2] <= security[3] <= security[4].
On day 3, we have security[1] >= security[2] >= security[3] <= security[4] <= security[5].
No other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank.

code:
class Solution:
    def goodDaysToRobBank(self, security: List[int], time: int) -> List[int]:
        n  = len(security)
        pr = [0]*n
        c = 0
        for i in range(1,n):
            if security[i-1]>=security[i]:
                c += 1
            else:
                c = 0
            pr[i]=c
        su = [0]*n
        c = 0
        for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
            if security[i]<=security[i+1]:
                c += 1
            else:
                c = 0
            su[i] = c
        ans = []
        for i in range(n):
            if pr[i]>=time and su[i]>=time:
                ans.append(i)
        return ans
