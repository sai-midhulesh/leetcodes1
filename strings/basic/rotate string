Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.
A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.
For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true

code:
class Solution:
    def rotateString(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(s)-1):
            if s==goal[i:]+goal[:i]:
                return True
        return False
